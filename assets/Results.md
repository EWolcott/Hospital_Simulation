## Results:
### Average Patient Visit Time at 20 Patients per hour:
#### 1 Doctor and 1 Nurse - 75 minutes
#### 1 Doctor and 2 Nurses - 25 minutes
#### 2 Doctors and 1 Nurse - 13 minutes
    - These numbers confirm the hypothesis that more employees will bring down the wait times, but the latter two results also confirm that more doctors will allow more patients to be seen in a smaller amount of time given their ability to treat all patients. However, the right amount of nurse-to-doctor ratio could prove to be just as beneificial and more cost-conscious to the hospital. The hope of the simulation is to find the happy medium, where a hospital could take it's average patient rate in the past and apply it to this simulation in order to find both the most time efficient and most cost efficient method of staffing.
